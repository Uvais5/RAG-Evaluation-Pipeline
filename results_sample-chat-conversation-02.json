It can be difficult to decide whether to proceed with donor eggs or try with your own eggs, especially with a low AMH level. Several factors should be considered like success rates, costs, and your personal preferences. We have seen that fresh eggs have slightly higher success rates but are more expensive, while frozen eggs offer more flexibility and lower costs, with potentially slightly lower success rates. Many women with low AMH still consider trying IVF with their own eggs before moving to donor eggs. Have you tried IVF with your own eggs before, or is this your first IVF cycle?"

It's a very personal decision, and what's \"right\" depends on your individual priorities and circumstances. While using your own eggs might be emotionally preferable, success rates are generally lower with diminished ovarian reserve. IVF with donor eggs often has higher success rates, especially when using frozen donor eggs from an egg bank, where we guarantee at least 7 top-quality mature eggs. To help you make an informed decision, I recommend scheduling a consultation where we can discuss your specific case and success rates in detail. You can book a consultation call at [https://pages.razorpay.com/ivfconsultation](https://pages.razorpay.com/ivfconsultation). Have you had your antral follicle count tested via a vaginal ultrasound scan?"

This helps ensure the health of the eggs used in the IVF cycle. Also, we only use frozen eggs in our clinic to prevent the inadvertent transmission of HIV/AIDS through IVF.
